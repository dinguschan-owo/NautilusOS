## NautilusOS

NautilusOS is a web based operating system built entirely in html, css, and js and my biggest project yet!!  
boot it up, log in, and mess around like it’s a real desktop with apps, an app store, windows, a file explorer, taskbar, and more.

## ✨ features

there’s a ton to play with, but heres a quick rundown (but fr check them all out yourself):

- bootloader, account setup, and login screen  
- fully animated desktop environment  
- draggable + resizable windows  
- taskbar with running app indicators  
- start menu with user info and apps grid

## 💡 more about

this is mostly just a fun ui sandbox with no backend and no external data storage, it just seemed liek the logical next step after Helios Browser  
everything runs client-side.  
built just with html, css, and js (no frameworks, no cdns except icons/fonts)

---

## 🧠 try it

open the html file in your browser. that’s it.
