## This is a active beta version of NautilusOS that is very experemental and may have new features before they get pused to the main branch.

# NautilusOS

NautilusOS is a web based operating system built entirely in html, css, and js and my biggest project yet!!  
boot it up, log in, and mess around like itâ€™s a real desktop with apps, an app store, windows, a file explorer, taskbar, and more.

## âœ¨ features

- bootloader, account setup, and login screen  
- fully animated desktop environment  
- draggable + resizable windows  
- taskbar with running app indicators  
- start menu with user info and apps grid

## ðŸ’¡ more about

this is mostly just a fun ui sandbox with no backend and no external data storage, it just seemed liek the logical next step after Helios Browser  
everything runs client-side.  
built just with html, css, and js (no frameworks, no cdns except icons/fonts)

---

## ðŸ§  try it
