NautilusOS is a web based operating system built entirely in html, css, and js and my biggest project yet!!  
boot it up, log in, and mess around like it’s a real desktop — apps, windows, file explorer, taskbar, and more.

## 💡 more about

this is mostly just a fun ui sandbox with no backend and no external data storage, it just seemed liek the logical next step after Helios Browser  
everything runs client-side.  
built just with html, css, and js (no frameworks, no cdns except icons/fonts)

---

## 🧠 try it

open the html file in your browser. that’s it.
